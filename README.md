# Database Manager with GUI - Java&PostgreSQL🏖️

This Windows program was created for Laboratory of Information Systems course at the University of Calabria. It facilitates the management of your database and access to it.

## Usage 🚀

You can use it by modifying its code and adapting it to your database.
This program is designed to interface with a database for which you have access credentials. As can be seen from the code, the program connects to a PostgreSQL database with various credentials. To use it with your own database, change the URL, USERNAME, and PASSWORD and the other stuffs with your own data

I highly recommend using IntelliJ IDEA for configuring this program.
