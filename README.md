# Database Manager with GUI - Java&PostgreSQL 🛢

This Windows program was created for Laboratory of Information Systems course at the University of Calabria. It facilitates the management of your database and access to it.

## Usage 🚀

You can use it by modifying its code and adapting it to your database.
This program is designed to interface with a database for which you have access credentials. As can be seen from the code, the program connects to a PostgreSQL database with various credentials. To use it with your own database, change the URL, USERNAME, and PASSWORD and the other stuffs with your own data
> **Note:** ⚠️ For testing purposes, credentials are inserted in the code! To make it usable and obviously consistent, remove that garbage thing and implement your own access system with credentials stored in the database.

I highly recommend using IntelliJ IDEA for configuring this program.
