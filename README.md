# Caramella Beach Club DB GUI 🏖️

Welcome to Caramella Beach Club DB GUI repository! This Windows program is the subject of examination for the Laboratory of Information Systems course at the University of Calabria. It facilitates the management of the database and access to the system of the Caramella Beach Club.

## Usage 🚀

You can use it by modifying its code and adapting it to your database.
This program is designed to interface with a database for which you have access credentials. As can be seen from the code, the program connects to a PostgreSQL database with various credentials. To use it with your own database, change the URL, USERNAME, and PASSWORD and the other stuffs with your own data

I highly recommend using IntelliJ IDEA for configuring this program.
